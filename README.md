# MDK 3

This is a replication of the original MDK3 application.

It has been fixed for easier compilation and readability of the code and added compilation and runing support for OSX.

If you have any problems compiling the code on a Linux enviorment try going to `pcap.h` file at line `23` and replacing the comments between lines `24` and `25`.
